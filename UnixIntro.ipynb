    "Very general question time: What is it that computers *do*? Computers can interact with us, store information for us, run programs, etc. Computers can help us do science! We, as scientists, interact with computers in a couple of basic ways, through the **command line interface (CLI)** or a **graphical user interface (GUI)**. What are some examples of GUIs? Well, almost everything you're used to using is a GUI! Word, Excel, etc. GUIs are great because they require no memorization of syntax or knowledge of programming--you can simply use menus and icons to move, delete, or open a file. So why bother with CLI at all? Because it can be very convenient and powerful, and we will learn how! \n",

    "**COMMAND SHELL**: The command shell is a program that helps you communicate with your computer. You type a something into the terminal, and then the shell takes this and figures out what commands the computer needs to run and then orders the computer to do so. A commonly used shell for Unix is the Bash shell. Let's start off with some very basic shell commands. NOTE: Because I'm in this python notebook environment I need to include this first line with the percentage signs. It is called a magic function and it just helps me simulate being in the shell environment. You DO NOT need to use this.  "
