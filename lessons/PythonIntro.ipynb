    "# What is Python? \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an open source, interpreted, and object-oriented programming language. What does this mean? It means it can be freely used and modified by others, that it does not need to be compiled to run, and that it uses the concept of data structures called \"objects\" that have both attributes (data) and methods (procedures). \n",
    "\n",
    "# Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a great first language to learn because you do not have to worry about things like assigning types to your variables or memory allocation, and in addition the syntax is generally very readable for first-time users. Python is also a portable skill-set--there is LOTS that Python can do both within the field of astronomy and also outside of it. Note that there are some \"cons\" to Python which require some more clever workarounds. For example, because Python is an interpreted language it can be slow compared to something like C. \n",

    "# Ways to Use Python: \n",
    "- IPython Notebook (type ```ipython notebook``` to start in terminal and ```ctrl-c``` to exit) \n",
    " - In a given cell, type ``Enter`` to add new lines, ``Ctrl-Return`` or ``Shift-Return`` to run a line, and ``Alt-Return`` to run a line and add a new cell)\n",
    "- Python command line interpreter (type ```python``` to start in terminal and ```ctrl-d``` to exit)\n",
    "- IPython command line interpreter (type ```ipython``` to start in terminal and ```exit``` to exit)\n",
    "- Making and editing .py files in your favorite text editor (gedit, vim, emacs, nano, et al.)\n",
    " - You can also use Python IDEs (integrated development environment) once you get more comfortable, like Spyder or PyCharm\n",
